### Where do I get these games today? ###

You can buy them for real cheap and DRM-free on [GOG.com](http://www.gog.com/).  These upgrades will work with the versions provided by GOG.

### What about Ultima 4? ###

Ultima IV - Quest of the Avatar is not included in this project because it was already upgraded by other people:

* The [Ultima IV Upgrade Project](http://www.moongates.com/u4/upgrade/Upgrade.htm) was created by Aradindae Dragon and Wiltshire Dragon.  It was actually one of the sources of inspiration for the Exodus Project.
* Additionally, the [xu4](http://xu4.sourceforge.net/) engine by Time Machine Dragon is another fantastic way to run Ultima IV natively on many platforms and without the need for Dosbox.

However, I did make alternative versions of the musical arrangements that can be plugged into both u4up and xu4, all available under [downloads](https://bitbucket.org/mcmagi/ultima-exodus/downloads).

### What about Ultima 1? ###

Originally this project aimed to provide only EGA upgrades and music from the Apple II version.  Now that I've made a foray into VGA upgrades -and- it's been discovered that the Apple IIgs version of Ultima 1 has music, that's something I may consider getting to in the future.  But since this is on my own time and for free I'm certainly not offering any guarantees.

### Setting Up ###

I have detailed instructions on the wiki [here](https://bitbucket.org/mcmagi/ultima-exodus/wiki/Build_Environment) on how to set up the build environment.
