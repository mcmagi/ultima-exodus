1 - Disclaimer:

	Please note that Ultima is a registered trademark of Origin
	Systems, Inc (OSI).  This project is not affiliated with nor
	endorsed by OSI.  You must own a legal copy of Ultima III:
	Exodus in order to apply this patch.


2 - Project Scope:

	The goal of this project is to convert Ultima III: Exodus
	for the PC up to newer standards.

	The first phase of this project was to convert the legacy
	CGA (4-color) graphics to lesser-legacy EGA (16-color)
	graphics.  Let's face it: magenta, cyan, and grey were not
	exactly pleasing to the eye.  I conformed loosely to the
	C64 color scheme, and used some tiles from the PC versions
	of U1 & U4.  (As of v1.0, this phase is complete!)

	The second phase added MIDI music to the game. Many
	thanks go to Aradindae Dragon (co-author of the U4 MIDI
	Upgrade) for supplying me with the MIDI package in the
	first place.  (As of v2.0, this phase is complete!)

	The third phase of this project added VGA (256-color)
	graphics to the game.  Having a series of successes with
	other upgrade projects, I had learned quite a bit more
	about assembly language since I first started this hobby,
	so I modified the architecture to be more driver-oriented.
	This allows for easier maintenance and increased
	extensibility in the future.  It also enabled the addition
	of a driver to simulate CGA Composite mode.  (As of v3.0,
	this phase is complete!)

	Other goals that are not necessarily part of any particular
	phase include adding Quit and Restore hot keys, slowing
	down or controlling the game speed, and adding an
	option to disable the annoying "AutoSave" feature.  (As of
	v2.1, all these features have been added!)

	Future enhancements might entail modifying the sound effects
	to be generated by WAV/MP3 data, looking at using SVGA DOS
	libraries for higher-resolution graphics, and/or upgrading
	the frame limiter to use a full fledged timer (which would
	allow for finer tweaking).  At the moment though, I feel the
	U3 Upgrade is in a very good spot where it is, so don't expect
	these things any time soon (or perhaps ever).

3 - Current Features:

	This is currently Release 3.0, which supports the following
	features:

		1) Fully colored VGA (256-color) tiles
		2) Fully colored EGA (16-color) tiles
		3) A Composite-mode CGA (16-color) simulation driver
		   that operates on the CGA data
		4) EGA/VGA/Composite dungeons are also in color
		5) Peer Gems yield a multi-colored look at the world
		   map, versus only texture in the CGA, C64, and Apple
		   II versions
		6) Restore (ALT-R), Exit (ALT-X), and Main Menu (ALT-M)
		   hotkeys have been added to the game.  ALT-X is also
		   supported while at the Main Menu.
		7) A Frame Limiter that eliminates the need for moslo
		8) Enhanced MIDI Music from the C64 and Apple II versions
		9) Ability to Enable/Disable the AutoSave feature
		10) Replaces the 0-7 moon phases with actual moon icons


4 - Installation Instructions:

	1. The PC version of Ultima 3 must already be installed on
	   your hard drive.  If you have a previous version of the U3
	   Upgrade installed, please replace it with a fresh copy of
	   Ultima 3.  (be sure to back up your savegame files ROSTER.ULT
	   and PARTY.ULT if you do)
	2. Unzip the U3 Upgrade zip file into your Ultima 3 directory
	   on your hard drive.  This step will not affect your current
	   installation or saved games.
	3. Start your DOS emulator (e.g. DOSBox) and navigate to the
	   Ultima 3 directory.
	4. Run BINPAT.EXE U3UP-30.PAT to apply the binary patch to the
	   game files.
	5. Run U3CFG.EXE to configure the game options.  If no prior
	   configuration exists, the game options will be initialized to
	   the default recommended options.  Modify them if you wish then
	   press 7 to save the configuration and exit.
	6. If you enabled MIDI music, run SETM.EXE from the Ultima 3
	   directory to configure your sound card.
	7. Run ULTIMA3.COM from the Ultima 3 directory to start the
	   game.
	8. Email me with suggestions and/or bugs.

	Optional steps:

	- You can run U3RESET.EXE to reset the game map if you want
	your party to enter an uncharted Sosaria.  Your party must
	be dispersed in order to clear the map.  This program will
	not affect the Roster.

6 - Credits:

	Thanks to all the people who have submitted comments, suggestions, 
	and bug reports thus far.  Your comments are greatly appreciated,
	and have helped to make this a better upgrade to a great game!

	Thanks twofold to Aradindae Dragon (Ryan Wiener) for a) supplying
	me with the Midpak drivers and b) helping me to get them working
	properly.

	Thanks also to Wiltshire Dragon for his beautiful VGA tileset
	from the Ultima IV Upgrade, without which I would have to go
	scouring the 'net for graphic artists willing to do this.

	Thanks to NewRisingSun for posting Composite CGA screenshots to
	MobyGames, inspiring me to return to the U3 Upgrade and write a
	Composite CGA simulator.

	Thanks to the Ultima Dragons of rgcud for, well, just being the
	outspoken group that they are.

	And thanks especially to Richard Garriot for creating Ultima III
	in CGA and forcing us to play it on RGB monitors, thus inspiring
	me to learn assembly.  ;)
