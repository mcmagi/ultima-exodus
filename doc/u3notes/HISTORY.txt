Project Status:

	01-08-2002 - Release 2.5:

	I have made only one bugfix to this release:

	- It looks like there was a problem updating the main Sosaria map
	  when leaving Ambrosia.  It turned out to be a result of not having
	  cached the main map to memory as the game does when entering a
	  town.  I found the problem code and repaired it.

	Please see below for an abbreviated project history or visit the
	project website (http://exodus.voyd.net/) for the complete status
	history.  I also post relevant information on project updates to
	the rec.games.computer.ultima.series and .dragons newsgroups.


Known Issues:

	None at this time.
