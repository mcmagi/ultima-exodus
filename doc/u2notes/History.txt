Project Status:

	09-29-2001 - Release 1.1:

	This is a maintenance release of the U2 EGA Upgrade, which has a
	lot of new features.  Updates since the previous release are:

	 - I finished the converting all TLK files to lower-case text where
	   necessary.  I tried to base most of the changes on the "Enhanced"
	   U2 that was released for the Apple II.  I'm not sure if I got all
	   of it right, but I'm sure it's close enough.

	 - Upgraded RENGAL.BAT so that running it twice does not generate
	   a stream of errors.

	 - I created a new program, U2RESET.EXE, which resets your saved game
	   in the event you want to start from scratch.  Previously, it was
	   required to recopy all the MAP and MON files from the CD, but
	   that is no longer necessary.  The program removes all monsters,
	   vehicles, and moongates from the map, clears the monster files,
	   and resets the player file.  It also restocks Legends with Minax's
	   monster hoard and Pluto with a few modes of transport.

	 - Fixed a problem where the game would exit with an error after
	   creating a character.


	Please see below for an abbreviated project history or visit the
	project website (http://exodus.voyd.net/) for the complete status
	history.  I also post relevant information on project updates to
	the rec.games.computer.ultima.series and .dragons newsgroups.


Known Issues:

	There will be some compatibility problems with the save games between
	the CGA and EGA versions if you save on a non-Earth planet or save
	while on a vehicle.  If you saved your game on the inner planets
	(Mercury-Jupiter) and you attempt to start the CGA program, your
	game will load on one of the Earth time periods.  You will get a
	"Wrong Disk" message if you attempt the same with the outer planets.
	Saving with a vehicle in the EGA upgrade will result in that vehicle
	being lost in the CGA version.  This is by design.  It is therefore
	recommended that if you started your game on the EGA version, you
	finish it on the EGA version.  There is no problem migrating save
	games in the other direction, that is using a saved game from the
	CGA version on the EGA upgrade.
